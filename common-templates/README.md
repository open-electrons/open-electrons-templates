This project is a collection of standard templates to be used by all open-electrons projects. Following are the list of current templatesa and how to use them.

## Scala Steward Config
The [scala-steward.conf file](https://github.com/open-electrons/open-electrons-templates/blob/master/common-templates/scala-steward.conf) is used across all the projects to stack and group several updates and to ignore several others. For example., updating
the Scala library is ignored. Any configuration changes for [scala steward](https://github.com/scala-steward-org/scala-steward) should be done in this
file here. It is then automatically applied to all open-electrons projects where this file is pulled dynamically.
